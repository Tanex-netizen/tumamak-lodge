# Profile Bookings Display Fix

## Issue
Bookings were created successfully in the database but not appearing in the Profile page under "My Bookings" tab.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **useEffect Dependency Issue**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) { /* ... */ }
  fetchMyBookings();
}, [user, fetchMyBookings]); // fetchMyBookings causes infinite loop
```

**Problem**: `fetchMyBookings` is a Zustand store function that gets recreated on every render. Having it in the dependency array causes the effect to run repeatedly or not trigger properly.

### 2. **No Refresh on Tab Switch**
When switching to the "My Bookings" tab, bookings weren't being fetched.

### 3. **No Loading State**
User couldn't see if bookings were being loaded.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Fixed useEffect Dependencies**
```javascript
// AFTER (Fixed)
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    setProfileData({ /* ... */ });
    setImagePreview(user.profileImage || '');
  }
}, [user]);

useEffect(() => {
  fetchMyBookings();
}, []); // Fetch once on mount
```

### 2. **Added Fetch on Tab Switch**
```javascript
<button
  onClick={() => {
    setActiveTab('bookings');
    fetchMyBookings(); // Refresh bookings when switching to this tab
  }}
>
  My Bookings
</button>
```

### 3. **Added Loading State**
```javascript
{loading && (
  <Card className="p-8 text-center">
    <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-b-2 border-brown-600 mx-auto mb-4"></div>
    <p className="text-brown-600">Loading bookings...</p>
  </Card>
)}
```

### 4. **Added Debug Info (Development Only)**
```javascript
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
  <div className="p-4 bg-gray-100 rounded text-sm">
    <p>Total bookings: {bookings.length}</p>
    <p>Upcoming: {upcomingBookings.length}</p>
    <p>Past: {pastBookings.length}</p>
    <p>Loading: {loading ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
  </div>
)}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear browser cache and refresh**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)

2. **Navigate to Profile page**
   - Click on your profile dropdown
   - Select "Profile"

3. **Switch to My Bookings tab**
   - Click "My Bookings" tab
   - Should see loading spinner briefly
   - Debug info will show booking counts

4. **Verify booking appears**
   - Your recent booking should be in "Upcoming Bookings"
   - Should show:
     - Room name and image
     - Status: pending
     - Payment Status: unpaid
     - Check-in/out dates
     - Guest count
     - Total amount

5. **Test refresh**
   - Switch to Profile tab
   - Switch back to My Bookings
   - Bookings should reload

## What to Expect

### Booking Details Displayed:
- **Room**: Room 1 (or whichever you booked)
- **Status Badge**: Yellow "pending"
- **Payment Badge**: Orange "unpaid"
- **Check-in**: Oct 17, 2025 12:00 AM (or your selected time)
- **Check-out**: Oct 18, 2025 12:00 AM
- **Guests**: 1 Adult
- **Duration**: 2 period(s) (12h each)
- **Total**: â‚±1,120 (â‚±1,000 subtotal + â‚±120 fee)

### Actions Available:
- **Cancel Booking** button (red outline)
- Clicking it opens confirmation modal

## Troubleshooting

If bookings still don't appear:

1. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for red errors
   - Check Network tab for failed API calls

2. **Verify authentication**
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Check localStorage for token: `localStorage.getItem('token')`

3. **Check API response**
   - In DevTools Network tab
   - Find `my-bookings` request
   - Check response shows your bookings

4. **Verify booking in database**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node -e "
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/tumamak-lodge').then(async () => {
     const Booking = mongoose.model('Booking', new mongoose.Schema({}, { strict: false }));
     const bookings = await Booking.find({ user: 'YOUR_USER_ID' });
     console.log(JSON.stringify(bookings, null, 2));
     process.exit(0);
   });
   "
   ```

5. **Hard refresh the page**
   - `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux)
   - `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

## Debug Info Explanation

When in development mode, you'll see a gray box at the top of the bookings tab:
- **Total bookings**: Number of bookings fetched from API
- **Upcoming**: Bookings with pending/confirmed status and future check-in
- **Past**: Bookings that are checked-out, cancelled, or have past check-out date
- **Loading**: Whether bookings are currently being fetched

This info will help diagnose issues. Once everything works, you can remove this debug section.
